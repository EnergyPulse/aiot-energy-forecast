# Overview

## 🌍 Background

The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems — from data centers to microcontrollers — is reshaping energy demands globally. With over **19.8 billion** IoT devices projected by 2025, and **~2 billion** capable of on-device AI inference (AIoT), it's vital to understand the energy footprint of this emerging infrastructure.

Recent estimates show that:

- ⚡ Global data centers already consume **415–460 TWh** annually.
- ⚡ AI-related workloads could double data center energy usage by 2030.
- ⚡ AIoT edge devices alone may account for **112–131 TWh/year** by 2025 — roughly **0.4–0.45%** of global electricity.

While AI promises efficiency gains in other sectors, its own energy impact risks becoming a bottleneck — particularly at the **edge** where deployment is widespread and decentralized.

## 🌟 Project Goal

This project provides a unified, open-source forecasting toolkit to model and simulate energy consumption trends in AIoT ecosystems. By bridging:

- Device-level energy measurements (Bottom-Up),
- Workload-level inference metrics (Top-Down),
- and Spatially distributed simulations (Agent-Based Modeling),

we enable deeper understanding and proactive planning for AIoT sustainability.
